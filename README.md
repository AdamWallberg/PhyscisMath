# PhyscisMath
Math library made for Physcis Engine.

This library contains basic math functions, classes for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors, and 4x4 matrices. 
It's made to work with OpenGL, but using it with other graphics API's shouldn't be a problem.

Should work with most compilers and platforms, the pre-built libraries are built for vs2015 using debug and release configurations on Win32 and Win64. 

WARNING: Ugly code at the moment, there's a major refractoring on its way.
